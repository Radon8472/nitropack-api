# Unofficial NitroPack API SDK

This repo is mainly based on https://nitropack.io/download/plugin/nitropack-php-sdk-limited-support.
The branch `native-api-libs` contains the native api files delivered by nitropack.io

This lib has a strange project structure so we will fix this in the future and add real composer support,
without big modifications on the code of the native lib-files.

## Installation
include this project as submodule or download the content into your desired directory
