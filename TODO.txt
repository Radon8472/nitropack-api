- Import old versions (e.g. different states of 1.19.2) from https://nitropack.io/download
  - Check history of WordPress and OpenCart plugin, they contain different versions of 1.19.2 maybe older
    - Add entries to Changelog (at least empty entry where features could be added when we know them)
    - and "master" version of this api-repo
  - import all of this versions into here and rebase branch "native-api-libs" on top of this
